# Excavating deep with `block` elements

As you could see in the last assignment, `block`s elements such as `<div>`s renders with a width of 100% of its parent. That width could be changed as you did setting a value to their `width` property. But, even when their width size is small, every other `<div>`s were rendered above each others. That happens because of their layout. The `display: block` value makes element to behave that way.

**Let's build the colors of world!**
